Documentation

Documentation is generated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and can be browsed locally from the /docs/build/html directory.


Hacking and Contributing
------------------------

The JavaScript code is now generated from TypeScript, so make sure you modify the
TypeScript and compile it, rather than modifying the JavaScript directly. To start
auto-compiling the TypeScript code, you may use:

```
/home/sophys> npm run auto-build
```

A very important part of sophys is its exhaustive test cases, so before making any
bug fix, please add a test case that fails prior to the fix, and succeeds after the
fix. All regression tests must pass.

Pull requests are always welcome, but please keep a few points in mind:

- Compatibility-breaking changes will not be accepted; they may be considered for the next major version
- Security is important; adding dependencies require fairly convincing arguments
- The library aims to be lean, so keep an eye on the `dist/sophys.min.js` filesize before and after your changes
- Add test cases for both expected and unexpected input
- Any new features need to be supported by us (issues, documentation, testing), so anything that is overly complicated or specific may not be accepted

If in doubt, please start an issue, and we can have a nice public discussion. :)
